Description:
    PyLineBreak is a script that breaks any text that it's fed into a format
    that's a bit more pleasing to read on a TTY / teminal emulator.  You can
    use it to dump the text directly to stdout or you can write text to a file.

-h or --help will print the help screen.
-v or --version will print the version and contact information.


USAGE:  pylinebreak [input] [output]

PyLineBreak reads from a file (or stdin), formats any especially long lines
that it finds in the text, and outputs to stdout (or, optionally, a file).

Examples:

pylinebreak FILE.txt
    This will read the text in FILE.txt, format it, and dump it to stdout

pylinebreak FILE_1.txt FILE_2.txt
    This will read the text from FILE_1.txt, format the text, and write it to
    FILE_2.txt.

cat somefile | pylinebreak - | some_other_program
    This concatenates the text from 'somefile', dumping it to stdout.  Stdout is
    then piped to pylinbreak which reads from stdin ('-'), the results of which
    are then piped again to some_other_program.
